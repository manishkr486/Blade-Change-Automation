# Blade-Change-Automation
The blade is picked up from the blade holder by
using a vacuum pump attached to a gripper and then
a stepper motor opens the blade holder and then at
an inclined angle the blade was perfectly placed in
the blade holder, after the stepper closes the holder
microtome is ready to take the sections. Here I have
used the BTT SKR2 board for controlling the motion
of the stepper, Dynamixel Motor, and Rpi Pico.
